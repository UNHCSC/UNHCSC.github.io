# UNH Cybersecurity Website

This is the primary website for the UNH Cybersecurity Clube. Below are details on how to setup and edit the website.

## Prerequisites

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) - Used to run Jekyll site
    - I Recommend using [RVM](https://rvm.io/) to install Ruby
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - Self-explanatory
    - With ruby run ```gem install jekyll```

## Setup Project
1. Install project dependencies:
    ```shell
    bundle install
    ```

2. Run project locally:
    ```shell
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```
    This should run the project at *localhost:4000*
